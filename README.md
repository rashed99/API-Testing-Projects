# Dmoney REST API Automation

## Project Summary: 
Dmoney is a demo platform for handling money transactions. It supports features like deposit and withdraw money, send money, making payments, and more.
I made a feature that allows the dmoney admin to give roles like Customer, Agent, or Merchant to users. I also added test cases to check if the roles and their actions are 
working properly.
